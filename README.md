LibKEA is a project to provide an implementation of the GDAL specification within the the HDF5 file format. Specifically, the format will support raster attribute tables (commonly not included within other formats), image pyramids, GDAL meta-data, in-built statistics while also providing large file handling with compression used throughout the file. Being based on the HDF5 standard, it will also provide a base from which other formats could be derived and will be a good choice for long term data archiving. An independent software library (libKEA) has been provided through which complete access to the KEA image format is provided alongside a GDAL driver allowing KEA images to be used through any GDAL supported software.
