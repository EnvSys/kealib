1. Install HDF5 with C++ bindings

2. Use cmake to configure the build for your system. You may need to
   set HDF5_ROOT to point at your HDF5 install. To build the included GDAL driver
   you will need to set LIBKEA_WITH_GDAL=ON (GDAL will need to be already installed).

3. Run the "make" and "make install" steps (there is also a "make test" target).
