How to create a distribution of kealib. 

1. Ensure that you have fetched and committed everything which needs to go in.
2. Update the LIBKEA_VERSION_MAJOR, LIBKEA_VERSION_MINOR, LIBKEA_VERSION_PATCH
   and LIBKEA_HG_VERSION fields in CMakeLists.txt. Version number
   is of the form MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, as discussed below. 
3. Close any inactive branches.
4. Update Changes.txt, by going through the 
   change logs since the last release, and noting what has been done. 
   DON'T FORGET TO COMMIT THIS, BEFORE THE NEXT STEP!!!!
5. Use "hg tag" to add a version number tag, e.g.
    hg tag kealib-1.4.8
6. hg push
7. Create .zip and .tar.gz using the 'hg archive' command and the tag
   created in the previous step:
    hg archive -r kealib-1.4.8 -t tgz kealib-1.4.8.tar.gz
    hg archive -r kealib-1.4.8 -t zip kealib-1.4.8.zip
8. Update the kealib to the latest version on conda-forge by creating a PR at 
   https://github.com/conda-forge/kealib-feedstock.
9. Let the Spack guys know there is a new release.

Version Numbers.
The kealib version number is structured as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
- The MAJOR number should change for major alterations, most particularly those 
  which break backward compatability, or which involve major restructuring of 
  code or data structures. 
- The MINOR number should change for introduction of significant new features
  Note: this includes adding new data members on C++ classes as this breaks 
  ABI compatibility.
- The PATCH number should change for bug fixes or very minor changes. There should
  be no change to the ABI for these releases.
